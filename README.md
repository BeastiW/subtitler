# Subtitler

This is the Subtitler project for displaying Subtitles (2-Line-Text) in CasperCG from Songbooks e.G. Almond Blossom.
It uses NodeJS to create a Web-Server so you can access it from any Computer in the same network. CasperCG is expected to run on the same PC.

## Requirements

## Getting Started

1. Get CasperCG Server from http://builds.casparcg.com/
2. Convert the EPUB Songbooks to JSON Files using https://github.com/ka98/songExtractor
3. Start the Server using the Batch File
